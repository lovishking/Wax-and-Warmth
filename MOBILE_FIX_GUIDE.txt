🔥 MOBILE ACCESS TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE 🔥

❌ PROBLEM: Getting 404 NOT_FOUND errors on mobile
✅ SOLUTION: Your Windows Firewall is blocking mobile connections

🔧 METHOD 1: Add Firewall Rule (RECOMMENDED)
1. Right-click on PowerShell and select "Run as Administrator"
2. Run this command:
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Django Dev Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8000

🔧 METHOD 2: Temporarily Disable Firewall (QUICK TEST)
1. Open Windows Settings
2. Go to Update & Security > Windows Security > Firewall & network protection
3. Turn off "Domain network", "Private network", and "Public network" firewalls
4. Test your mobile access
5. REMEMBER TO TURN THEM BACK ON LATER!

🔧 METHOD 3: Use Different Port
Instead of port 8000, try port 80:
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80

Then access: http://192.168.0.101/ (no :8000 needed)

🔧 METHOD 4: Check Router Settings
Some routers have "AP Isolation" enabled which blocks device-to-device communication:
1. Access your router admin panel (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)
2. Look for "AP Isolation" or "Client Isolation" 
3. Disable it if enabled

📱 TEST STEPS:
1. After applying any method above, test on your computer first:
   - Open browser and go to http://192.168.0.101:8000/
   - Should show your website (not 404)

2. Then test on mobile:
   - Make sure both devices are on same WiFi
   - Open mobile browser and go to http://192.168.0.101:8000/

🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The error ID "bom1::t7x48-1760141016640-1d48a987f304" suggests you might be accessing a different URL
- Make sure you're typing http://192.168.0.101:8000/ exactly
- Don't use any other URLs or bookmarks
- Clear mobile browser cache if needed

✅ WORKING URLs FOR MOBILE:
- Home: http://192.168.0.101:8000/
- Shop: http://192.168.0.101:8000/shop/
- About: http://192.168.0.101:8000/about/
- Cart: http://192.168.0.101:8000/cart/

❌ WRONG URLs (will give 404):
- Don't use: localhost:8000
- Don't use: 127.0.0.1:8000
- Don't use: any https:// URLs
- Don't use: any domain names

🔍 QUICK DEBUG:
Try this on your mobile browser to test basic connectivity:
http://192.168.0.101:8000/debug/
