NEW LOGO REPLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

Your new logo with the black background and gold "WWW" design is ready to be implemented!

STEPS TO COMPLETE THE LOGO REPLACEMENT:

1. Save the new logo image (the one you just shared) as:
   c:\Users\Lovish Jaiswal\Desktop\Wax-and-Warmth\images\logo.jpg
   
2. Make sure to overwrite the existing logo.jpg file

3. The old logo has been backed up as: images\logo_old.jpg

CURRENT LOGO USAGE:
==================
The logo is used in the following locations (all will automatically update):

HEADER LOGOS (height="80"):
- index.html (line 19)
- shop.html (line 13) 
- about.html (line 14)
- contact.html (line 17)
- blog.html (line 16)
- cart.html (line 73)
- sproduct.html (line 14)

FOOTER LOGOS (height="60"):
- index.html (line 134)
- shop.html (line 78)
- about.html (line 95)
- contact.html (line 76)
- blog.html (line 136)
- cart.html (line 125)
- sproduct.html (line 642)

All these will automatically use your new logo once you replace the logo.jpg file!

LOGO SPECIFICATIONS:
===================
- Header logo displays at 80px height
- Footer logo displays at 60px height 
- Your new logo has a black background with gold text which will look great!
- The logo links to the shop page when clicked in the header

NOTE: Since your new logo has a black background, it will create a beautiful contrast with the website design.
